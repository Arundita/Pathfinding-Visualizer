This is a visualization tool that illustrates the working of the pathfinding algorithms to render the shortest path between two nodes.
Front-end is developed using React, Css, HTML. 
Created a start node, end node, obstacle nodes and a grid.
Generated animations to visualize the exploration made by the algorithm. The tool currently works for Dijktra's algorithm. Fututre work involves adding BFS, DFS, Greedy, and sorting algorithms with interactive UI.
